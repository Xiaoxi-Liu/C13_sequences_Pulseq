Instruction: We developed current PSD tv6_MNS based on the ‘EPIC code for the TOPPE interpreter’ version 6 (i.e. tv6, developer: Prof. Jon-Fredrik Nielsen). PSD tv6_MNS has been added Multi-Nuclear Spectroscopy (MNS) function, so it supported both 1H and other NMR sensitive nuclei. The PSD tv6_MNS has been tested on both 1H and 13C frequencies, so 1H scans in tv6_MNS will keep the same as in tv6.
